This is the group homework assigned during the course 'Nuclear Design' in the Nuclear Engineering Master of Science program at Politecnico di Milano.
The project consists of a thermo-mechanical 1-1/2 D analysis of a fuel pin for a Sodium Fast Reactor.
The investigation involves the design of some characteristic parameters in order to align with safety and operational goals:
- gap size
- cladding thickness
- plenum volume
